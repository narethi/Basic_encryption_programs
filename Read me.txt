This is an untested encryption program that uses a sinusodial equation generated from a passcode, the input
mechanism is not safe, so if you don't want to loose your data only use passcodes that use alpha-numeric values
(no spaces or special characters)

The basic caesar cipher is a 2 char shift

enjoy :)
